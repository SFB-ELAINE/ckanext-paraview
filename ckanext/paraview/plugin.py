def add_links (package_id, rsrc_id):
    '''
    Called in pvw_view.html when a user tries to open a resource using this view.
    The PVW Visualizer only displays files whose types it can recognize, so
    this function creates hard links for the resources in the same dataset as the
    viewed resource to file names with .stl extensions, which allows the
    Visualizer to open the files in the view. Since a user might want to view
    more than one file at once, all files in the dataset are processed and
    put into the same directory where they are all accessible from any
    resource's view. Each time the view is opened, we check to make sure that all
    resources in the dataset have been processed, since more may have been added
    since the last time someone viewed the dataset.
